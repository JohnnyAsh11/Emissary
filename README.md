# Emissary
---
## Description 

### Emissary is a 2.5D dungeon crawler created with MonoGame and while many of those elements are not currently implemented the content that is avaliable is in a really great place in more ways than one!  Emissary was created out of my desire to create something totally different than all my other projects.  Up to this game most of my projects have been platformers and as a result I began to notice that I was basically developing the same thing over and over again with rather minor code changes.  While this solidified the versatility of my design patterns for that genre of game, it felt like I was not creating something new.  This leads us to Emissary.  This game, programmatically, is the magnum opus of my current knowledge and skill level in programming.  Every solution, architectual decision, and algorithm is specifically designed to branch off of my design patterns and develop new ways to solve problems!

## Notes
- Emissary is still under development and far from finished
- This game was built with optimization in mind
- Near Future Plans:
-  - I want to add some enemies that have their own wanderering AI and seek AI
   - Fully fleshing out the inventory system
   - Making the items have an effect/do something in game
